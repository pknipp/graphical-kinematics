TO DO:
* solve phantom-globe bug, if it ever reappears
* control the drawn graph not with a mouse but with a vertical slider
* consider having the first onMouseEnter event trigger the rendering (albeit temporary) of a horizontal line-segment, to provide reassurance to the user that the mouse is working properly
* enable user to clear the graphs without having to readjust any of the slider(s)
