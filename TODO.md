TO DO:
* Smooth the derivative, perhaps based upon the chosen resolution.
* Include the last point in the derivative curve.
* Allow the user to choose (from drop-down) whether he/she is drawing x, v, or a.
* Depending upon whether user chooses x, v, or a, place 0, 1, or 2 vertical sliders next to the graph in order to set the IC.  (This'll need to resize, as ifac and dfac change.)
* Make the app more sympathetic to missed stripes.  Detect gaps and interpolate them?
